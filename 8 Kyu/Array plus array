// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

// P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  count=0;
  for(let value of arr1) {
    count+=value;
  }
  for(let value2 of arr2) {
    count+=value2
  }
  return count;
}
