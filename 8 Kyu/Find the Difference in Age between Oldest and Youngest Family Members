// At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family member’s age and the youngest family member’s age and calculate the difference between them.

// You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed ‘age’ of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].

function differenceInAges(ages){
  ages.sort(function(a,b){return a-b});
  let yAges = ages[0];
  let oAges = ages[ages.length-1];
  let difAges = oAges - yAges;
  let arrHasil = [];
  arrHasil.push(yAges, oAges, difAges);
  return arrHasil;
}
