// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

function removeChar(str){
 let newStr=[];
  for(value of str) {
    newStr.push(value);
  }
  let arrHasil = newStr.slice(1, newStr.length-1);
  arrHasil=arrHasil.join("");
  return arrHasil;
};
