// Write a function which will accept an array of numbers and calculate the variance for the array.
// The variance for a set of numbers is found by subtracting the mean from every value, squaring the results, adding them all up and dividing by the number of elements.

// For example, in pseudo code, to calculate the variance for [1, 2, 2, 3].

// mean = (1 + 2 + 2 + 3) / 4
// => 2

// variance = ((1 - 2)^2 + (2 - 2)^2 + (2-2)^2 + (3 - 2)^2)  /  4
// => 0.5
// The results are tested after being rounded to 4 decimal places using Javascript's toFixed method.

const variance = (numbers) => {
  let sum=0;
  for(value of numbers) sum+=value;
  let mean=sum/numbers.length;
  let count=0;
  for(nilai of numbers) count = count + Math.pow((nilai-mean),2);
  return count/numbers.length.toFixed(4)
}
